=== Bridge Package
The bridge model allows for the representation of the thematic, spatial and visual aspects of bridges and bridge parts in four levels of detail, LOD 1 â€“ 4. The bridge model of CityGML is defined by the thematic extension module Bridge (cf. chapter 7). Fig. 44 illustrates examples of bridge models in all LODs.

The bridge model was developed in analogy to the building model (cf. chapter 10.3) with regard to structure and attributes. The UML diagram of the bridge model is depicted in Fig. 45.

UML Model

A (movable or unmovable) bridge is represented by an object of the class Bridge. This class inherits its attributes and relations from the abstract base class _AbstractBridge. The spatial properties are defined by a solid for each of the four LODs (relations lod1Solid to lod4Solid). In analogy to the building model, the semantical as well as the geometrical richness increases from LOD1 (blocks model) to LOD3 (architectural model). Simple examples of bridges in each of those LODs are depicted in Fig. 46. Interior structures like rooms are dedicated to LOD4. To cover the case of bridge models where the topology does not satisfy the properties of a solid (essentially water tightness), a multi surface representation is allowed (lod1MultiSurface to lod4MultiSurface). The line where the bridge touches the terrain surface is represented by a terrain intersection curve, which is provided for each LOD (relations lod1TerrainIntersection to lod4TerrainIntersection). In addition to the solid representation of a bridge, linear characteristics like ropes or antennas can be specified geometrically by the lod1MultiCurve to lod4MultiCurve relations. If those characteristics shall be represented semantically, the features BridgeInstalla-tion or BridgeConstructionElement can be used (see section 10.5.2). All relations to semantic objects and geo-metric properties are listed in Tab. 7.

The semantic attributes of an _AbstractBridge are class, function, usage and is_movable. The attribute class is used to classify bridges, e.g. to distinguish different construction types (cf. Fig. 48). The attribute function allows representing the utilization of the bridge independently of the construction. Possible values may be railway bridge, roadway bridge, pedestrian bridge, aqueduct, etc. The option to denote a usage which is divergent to one of the primary functions of the bridge (function) is given by the attribute usage. The type of these attributes is gml:CodeType, the values of which can be defined in code lists. The name of the bridge can be represented by the gml:name attribute, which is inherited from the base class gml:_GML via the classes gml:_Feature, _CityObject, and _Site. Each Bridge or BridgePart feature may be assigned zero or more addresses using the address property. The corresponding AddressPropertyType is defined within the CityGML core module (cf. chapter 10.1.4).

Table Semantic themes of the class _AbstractBridge

The boolean attribute is_movable is defined to specify whether a bridge is movable or not. The modeling of the geometric aspects of the movement is delayed to later versions of this standard. Some types of movable bridges are depicted in Fig. 47.
