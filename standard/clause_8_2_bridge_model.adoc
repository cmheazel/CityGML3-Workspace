The Bridge module provides the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of bridges. Bridges are movable or unmovable structures that span intervening natural or built elements. In this way, bridges allow the passage of pedestrians, animals, vehicles, and service(s) above obstacles or between two points at a height above ground.
Bridges are represented in the UML model by the top-level feature type _Bridge_, which is the main class of the Bridge module. Bridges can physically or functionally be subdivided into bridge parts. In addition, bridges can be decomposed into structural elements, such as pylons, anchorages, cables, slabs, and beams.

The free space inside bridges is represented by rooms, which allows a virtual accessibility of bridges.
Bridges can contain installations and furniture. Installations are permanent parts of a bridge that strongly affect the outer or inner appearance of the bridge and that cannot be moved. Examples are stairways, signals, railings, and lamps. Furniture, in contrast, represent moveable objects of a bridge, like signs, art works, and benches.
Bridges can be bounded by different types of surfaces. In this way, the outer structure of bridges can be differentiated semantically into wall surfaces, roof surfaces, ground surfaces, outer floor surfaces, and outer ceiling surfaces, whereas the visible surface of rooms can be structured into interior wall surfaces, floor surfaces, and ceiling surfaces. Furthermore, the openings of bridges, i.e. windows and doors, can be represented including their corresponding surfaces.

The UML diagram of the Bridge module is depicted in <<bridge-uml>>. The Bridge module inherits concepts from the Construction module (cf. <<rc_construction_section>>). The Construction module defines objects that are common to all types of construction, such as the different surface types and the openings. A detailed discussion of Requirements Class Bridge can be found in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML3-Workspace/blob/master/19-072UG.html#bp_bridge-model_section[CityGML Users Guide].
