== Appearance Model

include::requirements/requirements_class_appearance.adoc[]

In addition to spatial properties, CityGML features have appearances – observable properties of the feature’s surface. Appearances are not limited to visual data but represent arbitrary categories called themes such as infrared radiation, noise pollution, or earthquake-induced structural stress. Each LOD can have an individual appearance for a specific theme. An appearance is composed of data for each surface geometry object, i.e. surface data. A single surface geometry object may have surface data for multiple themes. Similarly, surface data can be shared by multiple surface geometry objects (e.g. road paving). Finally, surface data values can either be constant across a surface or depend on the exact location within the surface.

CityGML’s appearance model is defined within the extension module Appearance (cf. chapter 7). The UML diagram of the appearance model is illustrated in <<appearance-uml,Appearance UML Diagram>>. The Data Dictionary for the Appearance Package is provided in section <<Appearance-dd,Appearance Data Dictionary>>.

The following sections provide additional information which may not be readily available through the UML Model.
