== Spatial Model

NOTE: This section was not generated from the CityGML Conceptual Model. TODO: identify where this info resides in the UML model, then update accordingly.

Spatial properties of CityGML features are represented by objects of GML3’s geometry model. This model is based on the standard ISO 19107 ‘Spatial Schema’ (Herring 2001), representing 3D geometry according to the well-known Boundary Representation (B-Rep, cf. Foley et al. 1995). 

CityGML actually uses only a subset of the GML3 geometry package, defining a profile of GML3. This subset is depicted in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. Further-more, GML3’s explicit Boundary Representation is extended by scene graph concepts, which allow the represen-tation of the geometry of features with the same shape implicitly and thus more space efficiently (chapter 8.2).

NOTE: Version 2.0 only provides conformance requirements for implicit geometries. Additional requirements will be needed for the other categories.
