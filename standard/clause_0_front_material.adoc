[big]*i.     Abstract*

CityGML is an open conceptual data model for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO fundation assures that the man-made features described in the City Models share the same spatial-temporal universe as the surrounding countryside within which they reside.

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.
