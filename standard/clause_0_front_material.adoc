[big]*i.     Abstract*

CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography Markup Language version 3.2.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.

OGC work on CityGML is discussed and coordinated by the OGC 3D Information Management (3DIM) Working Group. CityGML was initally implemented and evaluated as part of the OGC Web Services Testbed, Phase 4 (OWS-4) in the CAD/GIS/BIM thread.

Version 3.0 of this standards document was prepared by the OGC CityGML Standards Working Group (SWG). For further information see the https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=329[CityGML SWG] project on the OGC Portal.

CityGML also continues to be developed by the members of the Special Interest Group 3D (SIG 3D) of the GDI-DE Geodateninfrastruktur Deutschland (Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany) in joint cooperation with the 3DIM Working Group and the CityGML SWG within OGC. For further information see the SIG 3D http://www.sig3d.org/[Web Site].
