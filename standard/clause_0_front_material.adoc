[big]*i.     Abstract*

CityGML is an open conceptual model for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model builds on the ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO foundation assures that the man-made features described in the city models share the same spatio-temporal universe as the surrounding countryside within which they reside.

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.
