[big]*i.     Abstract*

CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography Markup Language version 3.2.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

There are significant changes between CityGML version 2.0.0 and CityGML version 1.0.0 (OGC document no. 08-007r1):

* New thematic modules for the representation of tunnels and bridges;
* Additional boundary surfaces for the semantic classification of the outer shell of buildings and building parts (OuterCeilingSurface and OuterFloorSurface);
* LOD0 representation (footprint and roof egde representations) for buildings and building parts;
* Additional attributes denoting a city object’s location with respect to the surrounding terrain and water surface (relativeToTerrain and relativeToWater);
* Additional generic attributes for measured values and attribute sets; and
* Redesign of the CityGML code list mechanism (enumerative attributes are now of type gml:CodeType which facilitates to provide additional code lists enumerating their possible attribute values).

Migration of existing CityGML 1.0 instances to valid 2.0 instances only requires changing the CityGML namespace and schema location values in the document to the actual 2.0 values.

OGC work on CityGML is discussed and coordinated by the OGC 3D Information Management (3DIM) Working Group.CityGMLwas initally implemented and evaluated as part of the OGC Web Services Testbed, Phase 4 (OWS-4) in the CAD/GIS/BIM thread.

Version 2.0 of this standards document was prepared by the OGC CityGML Standards Working Group (SWG). Future discussion and development will be led by the 3DIM Working Group.
