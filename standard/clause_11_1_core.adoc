=== Core

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

The CityGML Core module defines the basic concepts and components of the overall CityGML data model.  It forms the universal lower bound of the CityGML data model and, thus, is a dependency of all extension modules. Consequently, the core module has to be implemented by any conformant system. Primarily, the core module provides the abstract base classes from which thematic classes within extension modules are (transitively) derived. Besides abstract type definitions, the core also contains non-abstract content, for example basic data types and thematic classes that may be used by more than one extension module. The UML diagram in Fig. 21 illustrates CityGML’s core module, for the XML Schema definition see below and annex A.1.

.UML diagram of CityGML’s core module. The bracketed numbers following the attribute names denote the attribute’s multiplicity: the minimal and maximal number of occurrences of the attribute per object. For example, a name is optional (0) in the class _Feature or may occur multiple times (star symbol), while a _CityObject has none or at most one creationDate. Prefixes are used to indicate XML namespaces associated with model elements. Element names without a prefix are defined within the CityGML Core module.

==== Base elements

NOTE: [underline]#short# intro here

===== AbstractCityObjectType, _CityObject

NOTE: insert AbstractCityObjectType, _CityObject UML

===== CityModelType, CityModel

NOTE: insert CityModelType, CityModel UML

===== cityObjectMember

NOTE: insert cityObjectMember UML

===== AbstractSiteType, _Site

The abstract class _Site is intended to be the superclass for buildings, bridges, tunnels, facilities, etc. Future extension of CityGML (e.g. excavations, city walls or embankments) would be modelled as subclasses of _Site. As subclass of _CityObject, a _Site inherits all attributes and relations, in particular the id, names, external references, and generalisation relations.

NOTE: insert AbstractSiteType, _Site UML

==== Generalisation relation, RelativeToTerrainType and RelativeToWaterType

===== GeneralizationRelationType

NOTE: insert GeneralizationRelationType UML

===== RelativeToTerrainType, RelativeToWaterType

NOTE: insert RelativeToTerrainType, RelativeToWaterType UML

==== External references

An ExternalReference defines a hyperlink from a _CityObject to a corresponding object in another information system, for example in the German cadastre (ALKIS), the German topographic information system (ATKIS), or the OS MasterMap®. The reference consists of the name of the external information system, represented by an URI, and the reference of the external object, given either by a string or by an URI. If the informationSystem element is missing in the ExternalReference, the ExternalObjectReference must be an URI.

===== ExternalReferenceType, ExternalObjectReferenceType

NOTE: insert ExternalReferenceType, ExternalObjectReferenceType UML

==== Address information

The CityGML core module provides the means to represent address information of real-world features within virtual city models. Since not every real-world feature is assigned an address, a correspondent address property is not defined for the base class _CityObject, but has to be explicitly modelled for a thematic subclass. For example, the building model declares address properties for its classes _AbstractBuilding and Door. Both classes are referencing the corresponding data types of the core module to represent address information (cf. chapter 10.3).

===== AddressPropertyType, AddressType, Address

NOTE: insert AddressPropertyType, AddressType, Address UML
