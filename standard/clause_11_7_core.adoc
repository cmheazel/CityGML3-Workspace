include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

The Core module defines the basic concepts and components of city models. This rather large body of work has been divided into five sections. These sections build on each other from the fundamental principles specified by the ISO up through the full CityGML model. These sections are summarized in the <<citygml-core-table>> table.

[[ISO-dependencies-section]]
==== ISO Dependencies

CityGML builds on the ISO 191** family of standards. The applicable standards are identified in the <<ISO-in-CityGML-diagram>> diagram. Data dictionaries are included for all of the ISO-defined classes explicitly referenced in the CityGML UML model. These data dictionaries are provided for the convinence of the user. The ISO standards are the normative source.

[[space-concepts-section,Space Concepts]]
==== Spatial Concepts

All city objects are differentiated into spaces and space boundaries. Spaces are entities of volumetric extent in the real world. Buildings, water bodies, trees, rooms, and traffic spaces, for instance, have a volumetric extent. Spaces can be classified into physical spaces and logical spaces. Physical spaces, in turn, can be further classified into occupied spaces and unoccupied spaces.

Space boundaries, in contrast, are entities with a real extent in the real world. Space boundaries can be differentiated into different types of thematic surfaces, such as wall surfaces and roof surfaces.

[[geometry-lod-section]]
==== Geometry and LOD

Spaces and space boundaries can have various geometry representations depending on the Level of Detail (LOD). Spaces can be spatially represented as single points in LOD0, multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3, solids in LOD1/2/3, and multi-curves in LOD2/3. Space boundaries can be represented as multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3 and as multi-curves in LOD2/3. All Levels of Detail allow for the representation of the interior of city objects. 

In addition, the geometry can also be represented implicitly, i.e. the shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry, which then is re-used or referenced, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in the 3D city model.

The thematic classes, such as building, tunnel, road, land use, water body, or city furniture are defined as subclasses of the space and space boundary classes within the thematic modules. Since all city objects in the thematic modules represent subclasses of the space and space boundary classes, they automatically inherit the geometries defined in the Core module.

[[CityGML-section]]
==== CityGML

City models are virtual representations of real-world cities and landscapes. A city model aggregates different types of objects, which can be city objects, appearances, different versions of the city model, transitions between different versions of the city model, and feature objects. All objects defined in CityGML are features with lifespan. This allows the optional specification of the real-world and database times for the existence of each feature, as is required by the Versioning module (cf. Section <<rc_versioning_section,  Versioning>>). Features that define thematic concepts related to cities and landscapes, such as building, bridge, water body, or land use, are referred to as city objects.

The UML diagram of the Core module is depicted in the <<core-uml,Core UML Diagram>>.

Since an infinite collection class cannot be implemented directly, a Boolean test for inclusion shall be provided by the GM_Object interface. This international standard concentrates on vector geometry classes, but future work may use GM_Object as a root class without modification.

The orientation of a surface chooses an "up" direction through the choice of the upward normal, which, if the surface is not a cycle, is the side of the surface from which the exterior boundary appears counterclockwise. Reversal of the surface orientation reverses the curve orientation of each boundary component, and interchanges the conceptual "up" and "down" direction of the surface. If the surface is the boundary of a solid, the "up" direction is usually outward. For closed surfaces, which have no boundary, the up direction is that of the surface patches, which must be consistent with one another. Its included GM_SurfacePatches describe the interior structure of a GM_Surface.
NOTE Other than the restriction on orientability, no other "validity" condition is required for GM_Surface.
