=== Core

The Core module defines the basic concepts and components of city models. City models are virtual representations of real-world cities and landscapes. A city model aggregates different types of objects, which can be city objects, appearances, different versions of the city model, transitions between different versions of the city model, and feature objects.
All objects defined in CityGML are features with lifespan. This allows the optional specification of the real-world and database times for the existence of each feature, as is required by the Versioning module (cf. Section <<rc_versioning_section,  Versioning>>).
Features that define thematic concepts related to cities and landscapes, such as building, bridge, water body, or land use, are referred to as city objects.

All city objects are differentiated into spaces and space boundaries. Spaces are entities of volumetric extent in the real world. Buildings, water bodies, trees, rooms, and traffic spaces, for instance, have a volumetric extent. Spaces can be classified into physical spaces and logical spaces. Physical spaces, in turn, can be further classified into occupied spaces and unoccupied spaces.
Space boundaries, in contrast, are entities with areal extent in the real world. Space boundaries can be differentiated into different types of thematic surfaces, such as wall surfaces and roof surfaces.
For a more detailed introduction to the Space concept see section [yellow-background]*+++<color rgb="#ff0000">xxx</color>+++*.

Spaces and space boundaries can have various geometry representations depending on the Level of Detail (LOD). Spaces can be spatially represented as single points in LOD0, multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3, solids in LOD1/2/3, and multi-curves in LOD2/3. Space boundaries can be represented as multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3 and as multi-curves in LOD2/3. All Levels of Detail allow for the representation of the interior of city objects. For a more detailed introduction to the Level of Detail concept see section [yellow-background]*+++<color rgb="#ff0000">xxx</color>+++*.
In addition, the geometry can also be represented implicitly, i.e. the shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry, which then is re-used or referenced, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in the 3D city model.
The thematic classes, such as building, tunnel, road, land use, water body, or city furniture are defined as subclasses of the space and space boundary classes within the thematic modules. Since all city objects in the thematic modules represent subclasses of the space and space boundary classes, they automatically inherit the geometries defined in the Core module.

City objects can have various relations. City objects can relate to generalized representations of the same real-world object in different Levels of Detail, they can also relate to other city objects, and they can reference corresponding external objects in other information systems, such as in the German cadastre (ALKIS), the German topographic information system (ATKIS), or the OS UK MasterMap®.
In addition, address information can be specified for city objects using the xAL address standard issued by the OASIS consortium (OASIS 2003).
