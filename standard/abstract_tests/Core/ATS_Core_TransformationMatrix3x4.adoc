^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/Core/TransformationMatrix3x4* 
^|Test Purpose |To validate that the Implementation Specification correctly implements the UML Basic Type Classes defined in the Conceptual Model
^|Requirement |<<req_Core_TransformationMatrix3x4,/req/Core/rc-TransformationMatrix3x4>>
^|Test Method |Manual Inspection
^|A |Validate that a date element exists with the same definition as that of the TransformationMatrix3x4 type in the Conceptual Model 
^|B |Validate that the data element has the same relationships with other elements as those defined for the TransformationMatrix3x4 type in the Conceptual Model. Validate that those relationships have the same source, target, direction, and cardinalities as those documented in the Conceptual Model.
^|C |Validate that the data element has the same properties (attributes) as those specified for the TransformationMatrix3x4 type in the Conceptual Model. Validate that those properties have the same name, definition, type, and cardinality of those documented in the Conceptual Model.
^|D |Validate that the properties of the data element include those of all parent classes of the TransformationMatrix3x4 type as documented in the Conceptual Model.
