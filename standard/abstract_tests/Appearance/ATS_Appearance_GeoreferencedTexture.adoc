^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/Appearance/GeoreferencedTexture* 
^|Test Purpose |To validate that the Implementation Specification correctly implements the UML Classes defined in the Conceptual Model
^|Requirement |<<req_Appearance_GeoreferencedTexture,/req/Appearance/rc-GeoreferencedTexture>>
^|Test Method |Manual Inspection
^|A |Validate that a date element exists with the same definition as that of the GeoreferencedTexture class in the Conceptual Model 
^|B |Validate that the data element has the same relationships with other elements as those defined for the GeoreferencedTexture class in the Conceptual Model. Validate that those relationships have the same source, target, direction, and cardinalities as those documented in the Conceptual Model.
^|C |Validate that the data element has the same properties (attributes) as those specified for the GeoreferencedTexture class in the Conceptual Model. Validate that those properties have the same name, definition, type, and cardinality of those documented in the Conceptual Model.
