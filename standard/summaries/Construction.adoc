^|*Class* ^|*Description*
|<<AbstractConstruction-section,AbstractConstruction>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractConstruction is the abstract superclass for objects that are manufactured by humans from construction materials, are connected to earth and are intended to be permanent. A connection with the ground also exists when the construction rests by its own weight on the ground or is moveable limited on stationary rails or if the construction is intended to be used mainly stationary.
|<<AbstractConstructionSurface-section,AbstractConstructionSurface>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractConstructionSurface is the abstract superclass for different kinds of surfaces that bound a construction.
|<<AbstractConstructiveElement-section,AbstractConstructiveElement>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractConstructiveElement is the abstract superclass for the representation of volumetric elements of a construction. Examples are walls, beams, slabs.
|<<AbstractFillingElement-section,AbstractFillingElement>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractFillingElement is the abstract superclass for different kinds of elements that fill the openings of constructive elements.
|<<AbstractFillingSurface-section,AbstractFillingSurface>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractFillingSurface is the abstract superclass for different kinds of surfaces that seal openings filled by filling elements.
|<<AbstractFurniture-section,AbstractFurniture>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractFurniture is the abstract superclass for the representation of furniture objects of a construction.
|<<AbstractInstallation-section,AbstractInstallation>> «FeatureType»  |AbstractInstallation is the abstract superclass for the representation of installation objects of a construction.
|<<CeilingSurface-section,CeilingSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A CeilingSurface is a surface that represents the interior ceiling of a construction. An example is the ceiling of a room.
|<<Door-section,Door>> «FeatureType»  |A Door is a construction for closing an opening intended primarily for access or egress or both. [cf. ISO 6707-1]
|<<DoorClassValue-section,DoorClassValue>> «CodeList»  |DoorClassValue is a code list used to further classify a Door.
|<<DoorFunctionValue-section,DoorFunctionValue>> «CodeList»  |DoorFunctionValue is a code list that enumerates the different purposes of a Door.
|<<DoorSurface-section,DoorSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A DoorSurface is either a boundary surface of a Door feature or a surface that seals an opening filled by a door.
|<<DoorUsageValue-section,DoorUsageValue>> «CodeList»  |DoorUsageValue is a code list that enumerates the different uses of a Door.
|<<ElevationReferenceValue-section,ElevationReferenceValue>> «CodeList»  |ElevationReferenceValue is a code list that enumerates the different elevation reference levels used to measure construction heights.
|<<EventValue-section,EventValue>> «CodeList»  |EventValue is a code list that enumerates the different events of a construction.
|<<FloorSurface-section,FloorSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A FloorSurface is surface that represents the interior floor of a construction. An example is the floor of a room.
|<<GroundSurface-section,GroundSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A GroundSurface is a surface that represents the ground plate of a construction. The polygon defining the ground plate is congruent with the footprint of the construction.
|<<InteriorWallSurface-section,InteriorWallSurface>> «FeatureType»  |An InteriorWallSurface is a surface that is visible from inside a construction. An example is the wall of a room.
|<<OtherConstruction-section,OtherConstruction>> «TopLevelFeatureType»  |An OtherConstruction is a construction that is not covered by any of the other subclasses of AbstractConstruction.
|<<OtherConstructionClassValue-section,OtherConstructionClassValue>> «CodeList»  |OtherConstructionClassValue is a code list used to further classify an OtherConstruction.
|<<OtherConstructionFunctionValue-section,OtherConstructionFunctionValue>> «CodeList»  |OtherConstructionFunctionValue is a code list that enumerates the different purposes of an OtherConstruction.
|<<OtherConstructionUsageValue-section,OtherConstructionUsageValue>> «CodeList»  |OtherConstructionUsageValue is a code list that enumerates the different uses of an OtherConstruction.
|<<OuterCeilingSurface-section,OuterCeilingSurface>> «FeatureType»  |An OuterCeilingSurface is a surface that belongs to the outer building shell with the orientation pointing downwards. An example is the ceiling of a loggia.
|<<OuterFloorSurface-section,OuterFloorSurface>> «FeatureType»  |An OuterFloorSurface is a surface that belongs to the outer construction shell with the orientation pointing upwards. An example is the floor of a loggia.
|<<RoofSurface-section,RoofSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A RoofSurface is a surface that delimits major roof parts of a construction.
|<<WallSurface-section,WallSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A WallSurface is a surface that is part of the building facade visible from the outside.
|<<Window-section,Window>> «FeatureType»  |A Window is a construction for closing an opening in a wall or roof, primarily intended to admit light and/or provide ventilation. [cf. ISO 6707-1]
|<<WindowClassValue-section,WindowClassValue>> «CodeList»  |WindowClassValue is a code list used to further classify a Window.
|<<WindowFunctionValue-section,WindowFunctionValue>> «CodeList»  |WindowFunctionValue is a code list that enumerates the different purposes of a Window.
|<<WindowSurface-section,WindowSurface>> «FeatureType»  |A WindowSurface is either a boundary surface of a Window feature or a surface that seals an opening filled by a window.
|<<WindowUsageValue-section,WindowUsageValue>> «CodeList»  |WindowUsageValue is a code list that enumerates the different uses of a Window.
|<<ConditionOfConstructionValue-section,ConditionOfConstructionValue>>   |ConditionOfConstructionValue enumerates different conditions of a construction. [cf. INSPIRE]
|<<ConstructionEvent-section,ConstructionEvent>> «DataType»  |A ConstructionEvent is a data type used to describe a specific event that is associated with a construction. Examples are the issuing of a building permit or the renovation of a building.
|<<Elevation-section,Elevation>> «DataType»  |Elevation is a data type that includes the elevation value itself and information on how this elevation was measured. [cf. INSPIRE]
|<<Height-section,Height>> «DataType»  |Height represents a vertical distance (measured or estimated) between a low reference and a high reference. [cf. INSPIRE]
|<<HeightStatusValue-section,HeightStatusValue>>   |HeightStatusValue enumerates the different methods used to capture a height. [cf. INSPIRE]
|<<RelationToConstruction-section,RelationToConstruction>>   |RelationToConstruction is an enumeration used to describe whether an installation is positioned inside and/or outside of a construction.
