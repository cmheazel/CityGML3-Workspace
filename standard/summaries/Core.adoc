|<<AbstractPointCloud-section,AbstractPointCloud>> |AbstractPointCloud is the abstract superclass to represent PointCloud objects.
|<<AbstractSpace-section,AbstractSpace>> |AbstractSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of spaces. A space is an entity of volumetric extent in the real world.
|<<AbstractSpaceBoundary-section,AbstractSpaceBoundary>> |AbstractSpaceBoundary is the abstract superclass for all types of space boundaries. A space boundary is an entity with areal extent in the real world. Space boundaries are objects that bound a Space. They also realize the contact between adjacent spaces.
|<<AbstractThematicSurface-section,AbstractThematicSurface>> |AbstractThematicSurface is the abstract superclass for all types of thematic surfaces.
|<<AbstractUnoccupiedSpace-section,AbstractUnoccupiedSpace>> |AbstractUnoccupiedSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physically unoccupied spaces. Unoccupied space refers to spaces that are entirely or mostly free of matter.
|<<AbstractVersion-section,AbstractVersion>> |AbstractVersion is the abstract superclass to represent Version objects.
|<<AbstractVersionTransition-section,AbstractVersionTransition>> |AbstractVersionTransition is the abstract superclass to represent VersionTransition objects.
|<<Address-section,Address>> |Address represents an address of a city object.
|<<CityModel-section,CityModel>> |CityModel is the container for all objects belonging to a city model.
|<<CityObjectRelation-section,CityObjectRelation>> |CityObjectRelation represents a specific relation from the city object in which it is included to another city object.
|<<ClosureSurface-section,ClosureSurface>> |ClosureSurface is a special type of thematic surface used to close holes in volumetric objects. Closure surfaces are virtual (non-physical) surfaces.
|<<DoubleBetween0and1-section,DoubleBetween0and1>> |DoubleBetween0and1 is a basic type for values, which are greater or equal than 0 and less or equal than 1. The type is used for color encoding, for example.
|<<DoubleBetween0and1List-section,DoubleBetween0and1List>> |DoubleBetween0and1List is a basic type that represents a list of double values greater or equal than 0 and less or equal than 1. The type is used for color encoding, for example.
|<<DoubleList-section,DoubleList>> |DoubleList is an ordered sequence of double values.
|<<DoubleOrNilReasonList-section,DoubleOrNilReasonList>> |DoubleOrNilReasonList is a basic type that represents a list of double values and/or nil reasons.
|<<ID-section,ID>> |ID is a basic type that represents a unique identifier.
|<<ImplicitGeometry-section,ImplicitGeometry>> |ImplicitGeometry is a geometry representation where the shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry, for example a tree or other vegetation object, a traffic light or a traffic sign. This prototypic geometry object can be re-used or referenced many times, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in the 3D city model.
|<<IntegerBetween0and3-section,IntegerBetween0and3>> |IntegerBetween0and3 is a basic type for integer values, which are greater or equal than 0 and less or equal than 3. The type is used for encoding the LOD number.
|<<IntervalValue-section,IntervalValue>> |IntervalValue is a code list used to specify a time period.
|<<MeasureOrNilReasonList-section,MeasureOrNilReasonList>> |MeasureOrNilReasonList is a basic type that represents a list of double values and/or nil reasons together with a unit of measurement.
|<<MimeTypeValue-section,MimeTypeValue>> |MimeTypeValue is a code list used to specify the MIME type of a referenced resource.
|<<NilReasonEnumeration-section,NilReasonEnumeration>> |NilReasonEnumeration is a code list that enumerates the different nil reasons.
|<<OccupantTypeValue-section,OccupantTypeValue>> |OccupantTypeValue is a code list used to classify occupants.
|<<OtherRelationTypeValue-section,OtherRelationTypeValue>> |OtherRelationTypeValue is a code list used to classify other types of city object relations.
|<<QualifiedAreaTypeValue-section,QualifiedAreaTypeValue>> |QualifiedAreaTypeValue is a code list used to specify area types.
|<<QualifiedVolumeTypeValue-section,QualifiedVolumeTypeValue>> |QualifiedVolumeTypeValue is a code list used to specify volume types.
|<<RelationTypeValue-section,RelationTypeValue>> |RelationTypeValue is a code list used to classify city object relations.
|<<TemporalRelationTypeValue-section,TemporalRelationTypeValue>> |TemporalRelationTypeValue is a code list used to classify temporal city object relations.
|<<TopologicRelationTypeValue-section,TopologicRelationTypeValue>> |TopologicRelationTypeValue is a code list used to classify topological city object relations.
