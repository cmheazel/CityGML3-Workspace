^|*Class Name* ^|*Description*
|<<AbstractSurfaceData-section,AbstractSurfaceData>> |AbstractSurfaceData is the abstract superclass for different kinds of textures and material.
|<<AbstractTexture-section,AbstractTexture>> |AbstractTexture is the abstract superclass to represent the common attributes of the classes ParameterizedTexture and GeoreferencedTexture.
|<<Appearance-section,Appearance>> |An Appearance is a collection of surface data, i.e. observable properties for surface geometry objects in the form of textures and material.
|<<GeoreferencedTexture-section,GeoreferencedTexture>> |A GeoreferencedTexture is a texture that uses a planimetric projection. It contains an implicit parameterization that is either stored within the image file, an acompanying world file or specified using the orientation and referencePoint elements.
|<<ParameterizedTexture-section,ParameterizedTexture>> |A ParameterizedTexture is a texture that uses texture coordinates or a transformation matrix for parameterization.
|<<TextureAssociation-section,TextureAssociation>> |TextureAssociation denotes the relation of a texture to a surface geometry object.
|<<X3DMaterial-section,X3DMaterial>> |X3DMaterial defines properties for surface geometry objects based on the material definitions from the standards X3D and COLLADA.
