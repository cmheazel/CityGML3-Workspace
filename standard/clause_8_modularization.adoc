== Modularization

CityGML is a rich standard both on the thematic and geometric-topological level of its data model. On its the-matic level CityGML defines classes and relations for the most relevant topographic objects in cities and region-al models comprising built structures, elevation, vegetation, water bodies, city furniture, and more. In addition to geometry and appearance content these thematic components allow to employ virtual 3D city models for sophis-ticated analysis tasks in different application domains like simulations, urban data mining, facility management, and thematic inquiries.

CityGML is to be seen as a framework giving geospatial 3D data enough space to grow in geometrical, topological and semantic aspects over its lifetime. Thus, geometry and semantics of city objects may be flexibly struc-tured covering purely geometric datasets up to complex geometric-topologically sound and spatio-semantically coherent data. By this means, CityGML defines a single object model and data exchange format applicable to consecutive process steps of 3D city modelling from geometry acquisition, data qualification and refinement to preparation of data for specific end-user applications, allowing for iterative data enrichment and lossless infor-mation exchange (cf. Kolbe et al. 2009).

According to this idea of a framework, applications are not required to support all thematic fields of CityGML in order to be compliant to the standard, but may employ a subset of constructs corresponding to specific relevant requirements of an application domain or process step. The use of logical subsets of CityGML limits the com-plexity of the overall data model and explicitly allows for valid partial implementations. As for version 2.0 of the CityGML standard, possible subsets of the data model are defined and embraced by so called CityGML mod-ules. A CityGML module is an aggregate of normative aspects that must all be implemented as a whole by a conformant system. CityGML consists of a core module and thematic extension modules.

The CityGML core module defines the basic concepts and components of the CityGML data model. It is to be seen as the universal lower bound of the overall CityGML data model and a dependency of all thematic exten-sion modules. Thus, the core module is unique and must be implemented by any conformant system. Based on the CityGML core module, each extension module contains a logically separate thematic component of the CityGML data model. The extensions to the core are derived by vertically slicing the overall CityGML data model. Since the core module is contained (by reference) in each extension module, its general concepts and components are universal to all extension modules. The following thirteen thematic extension modules are introduced by version 2.0 of the CityGML standard. They are directly related to clauses of this document each covering the corresponding thematic field of CityGML:

* Appearance (cf. clause 9),
* Bridge (cf. clause 10.5)
* Building (cf. clause 10.3),
* CityFurniture (cf. clause 10.9),
* CityObjectGroup (cf. clause 10.11),
* Generics (cf. clause 10.12),
* LandUse (cf. clause 10.10),
* Relief (cf. clause 10.2),
* Transportation (cf. clause 10.7),
* Tunnel (cf. clause 10.4)
* Vegetation (cf. clause 10.8),
* WaterBody (cf. clause 10.6), and
* TexturedSurface [deprecated] (cf. clause 9.8).

The thematic decomposition of the CityGML data model allows for implementations to support any combination of extension modules in conjunction with the core module in order to be CityGML conformant. Thus, the exten-sion modules may be arbitrarily combined according to the information needs of an application or application domain. A combination of modules is called a CityGML profile. The union of all modules is defined as the CityGML base profile. The base profile is unique at any given time and forms the upper bound of the overall CityGML data model. Any other CityGML profile must be a valid subset of the base profile. By following the concept of CityGML modules and profiles, valid partial implementations of the CityGML data model may be realised in a well-defined way.

As for future development, each CityGML module may be further developed independently from other modules by expert groups and information communities. Resulting proposals and changes to modules may be introduced into future revisions of the CityGML standard without affecting the validity of other modules. Furthermore, thematic components not covered by the current CityGML data model may be added to future revisions of the standard by additional thematic extension modules. These additional extensions may establish dependency relations to any other existing CityGML module but shall at least be dependent on the CityGML core module. Consequently, the CityGML base profile may vary over time as new extensions are added. However, if a specific application has information needs to be modelled and exchanged which are beyond the scope of the CityGML data model, this application data can also be incorporated within the existing modules using CityGML’s Applica-tion Domain Extension mechanism (cf. clause 10.13) or by employing the concepts of generic city objects and attributes (cf. chapter 10.12).

The introduced modularisation approach supports CityGML’s versatility as a data modelling framework and exchange format addressing various application domains and different steps of 3D city modelling. For sake of clarity, applications should announce the level of conformance to the CityGML standard by declaring the em-ployed CityGML profile. Since the core module is part of all profiles, this should be realised by enumerating the implemented thematic extension modules. For example, if an implementation supports the Building module, the Relief module, and the Vegetation module in addition to the core, this should be announced by “CityGML [Building, Relief, Vegetation]”. In case the base profile is supported, this should be indicated by “CityGML [full]”.

=== CityGML core and extension modules

Each CityGML module is specified by its own XML Schema definition file and is defined within an individual and globally unique XML target namespace. According to dependency relations between modules, each module may, in addition, import namespaces associated to such related CityGML modules. However, a single namespace shall not be directly included in two modules. Thus, all elements belonging to one module are associ-ated to the module’s namespace only. By this means, module elements are guaranteed to be properly separated and distinguishable in CityGML instance documents.

Compared to CityGML versions before 1.0, the aforementioned namespace conventions introduce an extra level of complexity to data files as there is no single CityGML namespace any more. In contrast, components of different CityGML modules and, thus, of different namespaces may be arbitrarily mixed within the same CityGML instance document. Furthermore, an application might have to parse instance documents containing elements of modules which are not employed by the application itself. These parsing problems though can easily be overcome by non-“schema-aware” applications, i.e. applications that do not parse and interpret GML applica-tion schemas in a generic way. Elements from different namespaces than those declared by the application’s employed CityGML profile could be skipped. Comparable observations have to be made when using CityGML’s Application Domain Extension mechanism (cf. clause 10.13).

As for version 2.0 of the CityGML standard, there are no two thematic extension modules related by dependen-cy. Thus, all extension modules are truly independent from each other and may be separately supported by implementations. However, the CityGML core module is a dependency for any extension module. This means that the XML schema file of the core module is imported by each XML schema file defining an extension.

The dependency relations between CityGML’s modules are illustrated in Fig. 8 using an UML package diagram. Each module is represented by a package. The package names correspond to the module names. A dashed arrow in the figure indicates that the schema at the tail of the arrow depends upon the schema at the head of the arrow. For CityGML modules, a dependency occurs where one schema <import>s another schema and accordingly the corresponding XML namespace. For example, the extension module Building imports the schema of the CityGML Core module. A short description of each module is given in Tab. 4.

Each extension module (indicated by the leaf packages) further imports the GML 3.1.1 schema definition in order to represent spatial properties of its thematic classes. For readability reasons, the corresponding dependencies have been omitted.

=== CityGML profiles

A CityGML profile is a combination of thematic extension modules in conjunction with the core module of CityGML. Each CityGML instance document shall employ the CityGML profile appropriate to the provided data. In general, two approaches to employ a CityGML profile within an instance document can be differentiat-ed:

. CityGML profile definition embedded inline the CityGML instance document A CityGML profile can be bound to an instance document using the schemaLocation attribute defined in the XML Schema instance namespace, http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance (commonly associated with the prefix xsi). The xsi:schemaLocation attribute provides a way to locate the XML Schema definition for namespaces defined in an XML instance document. Its value is a whitespace-delimited list of pairs of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) where each pair consists of a namespace followed by the location of that namespace’s XML Schema definition, which is typically a .xsd file. +
{nbsp} +
By this means, the namespaces of the respective CityGML modules shall be defined within a CityGML instance document. The xsi:schemaLocation attribute then shall be used to provide the location to the respective XML Schema definition of each module. All example instance documents given in Annex G follow this first approach.
. CityGML profile definition provided by a separate XML Schema definition file The CityGML profile may also be specified by its own XML Schema file. This schema file shall com-bine the appropriate CityGML modules by importing the corresponding XML Schema definitions. For this purpose, the import element defined in the XML Schema namespace shall be used, http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (commonly associated with the prefix xs). For the xs:import el-ement, the namespace of the imported CityGML module along with the location of the namespace’s XML Schema definition have to be declared. In order to apply a CityGML profile to an instance docu-ment, the profile’s schema has to be bound to the instance document using the xsi:schemaLocation at-tribute. The XML Schema file of the CityGML profile shall not contain any further content. +
{nbsp} +
The targetNamespace of the profile’s schema shall differ from the namespaces of the imported CityGML modules. The namespace associated with the profile should be in control of the originator of the instance document and must be given as a previously unused and globally unique URI. The profile’s XML Schema file must be available (or accessible on the internet) to everybody parsing the associated CityGML instance document.

The second approach is illustrated by the following example XML Schema definition for the base profile of CityGML. Since the base profile is the union of all CityGML modules, the corresponding XML Schema defini-tion imports each and every CityGML module. By this means, all components of the CityGML data model are available in and may be exchanged by instance documents referencing this example base profile. The schema definition file of the base profile is shipped with the CityGML schema package, and is accessible at http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/profiles/base/2.0/CityGML.xsd.

NOTE: replace XML with UML if feasible.

The following excerpt of a CityGML dataset exemplifies how to apply the base profile schema CityGML.xsd to a CityGML instance document. The dataset contains two building objects and a city object group. The base profile defined by CityGML.xsd is referenced using the xsi:schemaLocation attribute of the root element. Thus, all CityGML modules are employed by the instance document and no further references to the XML Schema documents of the CityGML modules are necessary.

NOTE: replace XML with UML if feasible
