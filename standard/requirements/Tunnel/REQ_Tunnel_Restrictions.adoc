^|A |The lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X  [1..4], properties (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractTunnel may be used to geometrically represent the exterior shell of a tunnel (as volume or surface model) within each LOD. For LOD1, either lod1Solid or lod1MultiSurface must be used, but not both. Starting from LOD2, both properties may be modelled in-dividually and complementary.
^|B |Starting from LOD2, the exterior shell of an _AbstractTunnel may be semantically decomposed into _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractTunnel. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloor-Surface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. The boundedBy property (not to be confused with the gml:boundedBy property) shall not be used if the tunnel is only represented in LOD1.
If the exterior shell is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representa-tion as volume or surface model using the lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X  [2..4], properties shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface within each LOD using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|C |Starting from LOD2, curve parts of the tunnel shell may be represented using the lodXMultiCurve, X  [2..4], property of _AbstractTunnel. This property shall not be used if the tunnel is only represented in LOD1.
^|D |Starting from LOD2, the outerTunnelInstallation property (type: TunnelInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractTunnel may be used to model TunnelInstallation elements. TunnelInstallation elements shall only be used to represent outer characteristics of a tunnel which do not have the significance of tunnel parts. The outerTunnelInstallation property shall not be used if the tunnel is only represented in LOD1.
^|E |Starting from LOD2, the geometry of TunnelInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of TunnelInstallation. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloor-Surface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
^|F |Starting from LOD3, openings of _BoundarySurface elements may be modelled using the opening property (type: OpeningPropertyType) of _BoundarySurface. This property shall not be used for _BoundarySurface elements only represented in LOD2. Accordingly, the surface geometry representing a _BoundarySurface in LOD2 must be simply connected.

The opening property of _BoundarySurface may contain or reference _Opening elements. If the geo-metric location of an _Opening element topologically lies within a surface component of the _BoundarySurface, the opening must also be represented as inner hole of that surface. The embrasure surface of an _Opening element shall belong to the relevant adjacent _BoundarySurface.
^|G |Starting from LOD4, the interiorHollowSpace property (type: InteriorHollowSpacePropertyType) of _AbstractTunnel may be used to semantically model the free space inside the tunnel by HollowSpace elements. This property shall not be used if the tunnel is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. The Hol-lowSpace element may be geometrically represented as a surface or volume model, using its lod4Solid or lod4MultiSurface property (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType).

In addition, different parts of the visible surface of a hollow space may be modelled by thematic _BoundarySurface elements. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSur-face as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. If the visible surface of a hollow space is repre-sented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representation as volume or surface model using the lod4Solid and lod4MultiSurface property shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|H |Starting from LOD4, the interiorTunnelInstallation property (type: IntTunnelInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractTunnel may be used to represent immovable objects inside the tunnel that are permanently attached to the tunnel structure. The interiorTunnelInstallation property shall not be used if the tunnel is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. Furthermore, the interiorTunnelInstallation property shall only be used if the object cannot be associated with a HollowSpace element. In the latter case, the hollowSpaceInstal-lation property (type: IntTunnelInstallationPropertyType) of the corresponding HollowSpace element shall be used to represent the object.
^|I |Starting from LOD4, the geometry of IntTunnelInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of IntTunnelInstallation. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
