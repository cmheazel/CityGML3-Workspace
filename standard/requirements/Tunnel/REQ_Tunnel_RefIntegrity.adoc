^|A |The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element _AbstractTunnel may contain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface ele-ment using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the boundedBy property may only point to a remote _BoundarySurface element (where remote _BoundarySurface ele-ments are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained ele-ment or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.

Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloorSurface and Clo-sureSurface elements are allowed to be encapsulated or referenced by the boundedBy property of _AbstractTunnel.
^|B |The outerTunnelInstallation property (type: TunnelInstallationPropertyType) of the element _AbstractTunnel may contain a TunnelInstallation element inline or an XLink reference to a remote TunnelInstallation element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.

Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|C |The interiorTunnelInstallation property (type: IntTunnelInstallationPropertyType) of the element _AbstractTunnel may contain an IntTunnelInstallation element inline or an XLink reference to a remote IntTunnelInstallation element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the interiorTunnelInstallation property may only point to a remote IntTunnelInstallation el-ement (where remote IntTunnelInstallation elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|D |The interiorHollowSpace property (type: InteriorHollowSpacePropertyType) of the element _AbstractTunnel may contain a HollowSpace element inline or an XLink reference to a remote Hol-lowSpace element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the interiorHollowSpace property may only point to a remote HollowSpace element (where remote Hol-lowSpace elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|E |The consistsOfTunnelPart property (type: TunnelPartPropertyType) of the element _AbstractTunnel may contain a TunnelPart element inline or an XLink reference to a remote TunnelPart element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the consistsOfTunnelPart property may only point to a remote TunnelPart element (where remote TunnelPart elements are locat-ed in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the refer-ence must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|F |The opening property (type: OpeningPropertyType) of the element _BoundarySurface may contain an _Opening element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _Opening element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the opening property may only point to a remote _Opening element (where remote _Opening elements are located in another document or else-where in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|G |The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element TunnelInstallation may contain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface ele-ment using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the boundedBy property may only point to a remote _BoundarySurface element (where remote _BoundarySurface ele-ments are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained ele-ment or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.

Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloorSurface and Clo-sureSurface elements are allowed to be encapsulated or referenced by the boundedBy property of Tun-nelInstallation.
^|H |The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element IntTunnelInstallation may contain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the bound-edBy property may only point to a remote _BoundarySurface element (where remote _BoundarySurface elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained el-ement or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface elements are allowed to be encapsulated or referenced by the boundedBy property of IntTunnelInstallation.
^|I |The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element HollowSpace may con-tain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.

Either the contained ele-ment or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.

Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface elements are allowed to be encapsulated or referenced by the boundedBy property of HollowSpace.
^|J |The interiorFurniture property (type: InteriorFurniturePropertyType) of the element HollowSpace may contain an TunnelFurniture element inline or an XLink reference to a remote TunnelFurniture element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the interiorFurni-ture property may only point to a remote TunnelFurniture element (where remote TunnelFurniture el-ements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained ele-ment or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|K |The hollowSpaceInstallation property (type: IntTunnelInstallationPropertyType) of the element Hol-lowSpace may contain an IntTunnelInstallation element inline or an XLink reference to a remote IntTunnelInstallation element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
