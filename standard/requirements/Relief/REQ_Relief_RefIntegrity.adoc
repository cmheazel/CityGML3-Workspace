^|A |The reliefComponent property (type: ReliefComponentPropertyType) of the element ReliefFeature may contain a _ReliefComponent element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _ReliefComponent ele-ment using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the reliefCom-ponent property may only point to a remote _ReliefComponent element (where remote _ReliefComponent elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Ei-ther the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|B |The tin property (type: tinPropertyType) of the element TINRelief may contain a gml:TriangulatedSurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote gml:TriangulatedSurface el-ement using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the tin prop-erty may only point to a remote gml:TriangulatedSurface element (where remote gml:TriangulatedSurface elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same docu-ment). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|C |The grid property (type: gridPropertyType) of the element RasterRelief may contain a gml:RectifiedGridCoverage element inline or an XLink reference to a remote gml:RectifiedGridCoverage element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the grid property may only point to a remote gml:RectifiedGridCoverage element (where remote gml:RectifiedGridCoverage elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
