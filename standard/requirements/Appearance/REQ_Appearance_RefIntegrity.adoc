^|*Requirement  {counter:req-id}* |*/req/appearance/refIntegrity* 
^|A |The appearanceMember element (type: AppearancePropertyType) may contain an Appearance element inline or an XLink reference to a remote Appearance element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the appearanceMember element may only point to a remote Appearance element (where remote Appearance elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|B |The appearance property (type: AppearancePropertyType) of the element core:_CityObject may con-tain an Appearance element inline or an XLink reference to a remote Appearance element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the appearance property may only point to a remote Appearance element (where remote Appearance elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|C |The surfaceDataMember property (type: SurfaceDataPropertyType) of the element Appearance may contain a _SurfaceData element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _SurfaceData element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the surfaceDataMember property may only point to a remote _SurfaceData element (where remote _SurfaceData elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|D |The target property (type: TextureAssociationType) of the element ParameterizedTexture may contain a _TextureParameterization element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _ TextureParameterization element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the target property may only point to a remote _ TextureParameterization element (where remote _ TexturePa-rameterization elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|E |The target property (type xs:anyURI) of the element GeoreferencedTexture shall specify the gml:id of the target surface geometry object which may only be of type gml:AbstractSurfaceType or gml:MultiSurface.
^|F |The uri attribute of the complex type TextureAssociationType shall specify the gml:id of the target sur-face geometry object which may only be of type gml:AbstractSurfaceType or gml:MultiSurface.
^|G |The ring attribute of the textureCoordinates property of the element TexCoordList shall specify the gml:id of the target surface geometry object which may only be of type gml:LinearRing.
^|H |The target property (type xs:anyURI) of the element X3DMaterial shall specify the gml:id of the target surface geometry object which may only be of type gml:AbstractSurfaceType or gml:MultiSurface.
