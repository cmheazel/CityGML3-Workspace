^|A |The lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X X E [1..4], properties (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractBridge may be used to geometrically represent the exte-rior shell of a bridge (as volume or surface model) within each LOD. For LOD1, either lod1Solid or lod1MultiSurface must be used, but not both. Starting from LOD2, both properties may be modelled in-dividually and complementary.
^|B |Starting from LOD2, the exterior shell of an _AbstractBridge may be semantically decomposed into _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractBridge. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloor-Surface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. The boundedBy property (not to be confused with the gml:boundedBy property) shall not be used if the bridge is only represented in LOD1. If the exterior shell is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representa-tion as volume or surface model using the lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X  [2..4], properties shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface within each LOD using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|C |Starting from LOD2, curve parts of the bridge shell may be represented using the lodXMultiCurve, X  [2..4], property of _AbstractBridge. This property shall not be used if the bridge is only represented in LOD1.
^|D |Starting from LOD1, the outerBridgeConstruction property (type: BridgeConstructionElementProper-tyType) of _AbstractBridge may be used to model BridgeConstructionElement elements. BridgeCon-structionElement elements shall only be used to represent outer characteristics of a bridge which do not have the significance of bridge parts and are essential from a structural point of view.
^|E |Starting from LOD2, the geometry of BridgeConstructionElement elements may be semantically classi-fied by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfaceProperty-Type) of BridgeConstructionElement. The boundedBy property (not to be confused with the gml:boundedBy property) shall not be used if the bridge construction element is only represented in LOD1.
^|F |Starting from LOD2, the outerBridgeInstallation property (type: BridgeInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractBridge may be used to model BridgeInstallation elements. BridgeInstallation elements shall only be used to represent outer characteristics of a bridge which do not have the significance of bridge parts and are not essential from a structural point of view.
^|G |Starting from LOD2, the geometry of BridgeInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of BridgeInstallation. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloor-Surface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
^|H |Starting from LOD3, openings of _BoundarySurface elements may be modelled using the opening property (type: OpeningPropertyType) of _BoundarySurface. This property shall not be used for _BoundarySurface elements only represented in LOD2. Accordingly, the surface geometry representing a _BoundarySurface in LOD2 must be simply connected. The opening property of _BoundarySurface may contain or reference _Opening elements. If the geo-metric location of an _Opening element topologically lies within a surface component of the _BoundarySurface, the opening must also be represented as inner hole of that surface. The embrasure surface of an _Opening element shall belong to the relevant adjacent _BoundarySurface.
^|I |Starting from LOD4, the interiorBridgeRoom property (type: InteriorBridgeRoomPropertyType) of _AbstractBridge may be used to semantically model the free space inside the bridge by BridgeRoom el-ements. This property shall not be used if the bridge is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. The BridgeRoom element may be geometrically represented as a surface or volume model, using its lod4Solid or lod4MultiSurface property (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType). In addition, different parts of the visible surface of a bridge room may be modelled by thematic _BoundarySurface elements. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSur-face as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. If the visible surface of a room is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representation as volume or surface model using the lod4Solid and lod4MultiSurface property shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to refer-ence the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|J |Starting from LOD4, the interiorBridgeInstallation property (type: IntBridgeInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractBridge may be used to represent immovable objects inside the bridge that are permamently attached to the bridge structure. The interiorBridgeInstallation property shall not be used if the bridge is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. Furthermore, the interiorBridgeInstallation property shall only be used if the object cannot be associated with a BridgeRoom element. In the latter case, the bridgeRoomInstal-lation property (type: IntBridgeInstallationPropertyType) of the corresponding BridgeRoom element shall be used to represent the object.
^|K |Starting from LOD4, the geometry of IntBridgeInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of IntBridgeInstallation. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
