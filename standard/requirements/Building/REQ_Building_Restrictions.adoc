^|A |The gml:MultiSurface geometries that are associated using the lod0FootPrint and lod0RoofEdge prop-erties must have 3D coordinates. For each surface, the height values of the coordinate tuples belonging to the same surface shall be identical.
^|B |The lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X  [1..4], properties (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to geometricllay represent the exte-rior shell of a building (as volume or surface model) within each LOD. For LOD1, either lod1Solid or lod1MultiSurface must be used, but not both. Starting from LOD2, both properties may be modelled in-dividually and complementary.
^|C |Starting from LOD2, the exterior shell of an _AbstractBuilding may be semantically decomposed into _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloor-Surface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. The boundedBy property (not to be confused with the gml:boundedBy property) shall not be used if the building is only repre-sented in LOD1. If the exterior shell is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representa-tion as volume or surface model using the lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X  [2..4], properties shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface within each LOD using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|D |Starting from LOD2, curve parts of the building shell may be represented using the lodXMultiCurve, X  [2..4], property of _AbstractBuilding. This property shall not be used if the building is only repre-sented in LOD1.
^|E |Starting from LOD2, the outerBuildingInstallation property (type: BuildingInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to model BuildingInstallation elements. BuildingInstallation elements shall only be used to represent outer characteristics of a building which do not have the significance of building parts. The outerBuildingInstallation property shall not be used if the building is only repre-sented in LOD1.
^|F |Starting from LOD2, the geometry of BuildingInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of BuildingInstallation. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, Outer-FloorSurface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
^|G |Starting from LOD3, openings of _BoundarySurface elements may be modelled using the opening property (type: OpeningPropertyType) of _BoundarySurface. This property shall not be used for _BoundarySurface elements only represented in LOD2. Accordingly, the surface geometry representing a _BoundarySurface in LOD2 must be simply connected.

The opening property of _BoundarySurface may contain or reference _Opening elements. If the geo-metric location of an _Opening element topologically lies within a surface component of the _BoundarySurface, the opening must also be represented as inner hole of that surface. The embrasure surface of an _Opening element shall belong to the relevant adjacent _BoundarySurface.
^|G |Starting from LOD4, the interiorRoom property (type: InteriorRoomPropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to semantically model the free space inside the building by Room ele-ments. This property shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. The Room ele-ment may be geometrically represented as a surface or volume model, using its lod4Solid or lod4MultiSurface property (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType).

In addition, different parts of the visible surface of a room may be modelled by thematic _BoundarySurface elements. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSur-face as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed. If the visible surface of a room is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representation as volume or surface model using the lod4Solid and lod4MultiSurface property shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to refer-ence the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
^|H |Starting from LOD4, the interiorBuildingInstallation property (type: IntBuildingInstallationProperty-Type) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to represent immovable objects inside the building that are permamently attached to the building structure. The interiorBuildingInstallation property shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD 1 – 3. Furthermore, the interiorBuildingInstallation property shall only be used if the object cannot be associated with a Room element. In the latter case, the roomInstallation property (type: IntBuildingInstallationPropertyType) of the corresponding Room element shall be used to represent the object.
^|I |Starting from LOD4, the geometry of IntBuildingInstallation elements may be semantically classified by _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of IntBuildingInstallation. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.
