Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|H |The address property (type: core:AddressPropertyType) of the element Door may contain an core:Address element inline or an XLink reference to a remote core:Address element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the address property may only point to a remote core:Address element (where remote core:Address elements are located in another docu-ment or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|I |The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element BuildingInstallation may contain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.
