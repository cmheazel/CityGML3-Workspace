^|*Requirement  {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/refIntegrity* 
^|A |The cityObjectMember element (type: gml:FeaturePropertyType) may contain a _CityObject element, which typically is an object from a derived subclass like bldg:Building, inline or an XLink reference to a remote _CityObject element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the cityObjectMember element may only point to a remote _CityObject element (where re-mote _CityObject elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
^|B |The type AddressPropertyType may contain an Address element inline or an XLink reference to a re-mote Address element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1. In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the corresponding element of type AddressPropertyType may only point to a remote Address element (where remote Address elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document). Either the contained element or the reference must be given, but neither both nor none.
