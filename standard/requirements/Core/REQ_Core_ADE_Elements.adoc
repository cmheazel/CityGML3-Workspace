2+|ADEs typically extend CityGML by defining new feature types together with additional content such as object types, data types, code lists, and enumerations.
^|A |Every feature type in an ADE SHALL be derived either directly or indirectly from the CityGML root feature type _core:AbstractFeature_ or a subclass thereof.
^|B |UML classes representing top-level feature types SHALL use the _&#171;TopLevelFeatureType&#187;_ stereotype.
^|C |Features representing spaces or space boundaries SHALL be derived either directly or indirectly from _core:AbstractSpace_ or _core:AbstractSpaceBoundary_ respectively.
^|D |An ADE may define new and additional spatial properties. If such a spatial property should belong to a predefined LOD, then the property name SHALL start with the prefix “lod__X__”, where _X_ is an integer value indicating the target LOD.
