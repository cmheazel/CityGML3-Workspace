=== Digital Terrain Model

include::requirements/requirements_class_relief.adoc[]

An essential part of a city model is the terrain. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of CityGML is provided by the thematic extension module Relief (cf. chapter 7). In CityGML, the terrain is represented by the class ReliefFea-ture in LOD 0-4 (Fig. 24 depicts the UML diagram, for the XML schema definition see annex A.9). A Re-liefFeature consists of one or more entities of the class ReliefComponent. Its validity may be restricted to a certain area defined by an optional validity extent polygon. As ReliefFeature and ReliefComponent are deriva-tives of _CityObject, the corresponding attributes and relations are inherited. The class ReliefFeature is associat-ed with different concepts of terrain representations which can coexist. The terrain may be specified as a regular raster or grid (RasterRelief), as a TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network, TINReflief), by break lines (BreaklineRe-lief), or by mass points (MasspointRelief). The four types are implemented by the corresponding GML3 classes: grids by gml:RectifiedGridCoverage, break lines by gml:MultiCurve, mass points by gml:MultiPoint and TINs either by gml:TriangulatedSurface or by gml:Tin. In case of gml:TriangulatedSurfaces, the triangles are given explicitly while in case of gml:Tin only 3D points are represented, where the triangulation can be reconstructed by standard methods (Delaunay triangulation, cf. Okabe et al. 1992). Break lines are represented by 3D curves. Mass points are simply a set of 3D points.

The UML diagram of the Relief Package is depicted in <<relief-uml,Relief UML Diagram>>. The Data Dictionary for the Relief Package is provided in section <<Relief-dd,Relief Data Dictionary>>.
