CityGML 3.0 Tools
===========

The CityGML Conceptual Model is a UML model maintained using SPARX Enterprise Architect. The OGC Specification for the CityGML Conceptual Model must be a faithful transcription of the UML model into an AsciiDoc document. This process must be automated to the greatest extent possible. This directory contains the tools developed for that purpose.

CityGML Template:

Enterprise Architect supports publication of the UML model as a report in RTF format. The contents and structure of that report is governed by a template. EA provides a number of built-in templates, or you can build your own. The CityGML template is a custom template designed to produce AsciiDoc formatted data dictionaries. A report published using this template can be imported directly into the AsciiDoc specification document.
