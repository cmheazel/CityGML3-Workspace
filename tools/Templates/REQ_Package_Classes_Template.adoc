^|*Requirement  {counter:req-id}* |*/req/PACKAGE/classes* 
^|A |The Requirement Classes CLASS shown in blue in Figure [nn] and documented in the REFF-section,PACKAGE Data Dictionary>> SHALL be provided for by the encoding specification in a manner consistent with the encoding technology.
^|B |The encoding specification SHALL provide a mapping between the concepts defined in the Conceptual Model and the representation of those concepts in the encoding.
^|C |The Implementation Specification SHALL contain an element with the same definition as the CLASS UML class as documented in the CLASS section of the REFF-section,PACKAGE Data Dictionary>>.
^|D |The Implementation Specification SHALL represent associations with the same source, target, direction, and cardinalities as those of the CLASS UML class as documented in the CLASS section of the REFF-section,PACKAGE Data Dictionary>>.
^|E |The implementation Specification SHALL represent the attributes of the CLASS UML class; including the name, definition, type, and cardinality of those documented in the CLASS section of the REFF-section,PACKAGE Data Dictionary>>.
^|F |The implementation Specification SHALL represent the attributes of all parent classes of the the CLASS UML class; including the name, definition, type, and cardinality of those documented in the CLASS section of the REFF-section,PACKAGE Data Dictionary>>.
^|G |The concepts included in these mappings SHALL include:

a) All classes shown as blue boxes (this Requirements Class) in the figure

b) All attributes, attribute cardinalities, and attribute data types of these classes (usually shown in subsequent figures)

c) All associations, navigation, roles, and role cardinalities connecting to the blue classes

d) All classes shown as beige boxes (another Requirements Class) in the figure connected to the blue box classes by association or used as attribute data types

e) All classes shown as pink boxes (another Standard) in the figure connected to the blue box classes by association or used as attribute data types
