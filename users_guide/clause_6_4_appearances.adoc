=== Appearances

In addition to semantics and geometry, information about the appearance of surfaces, i.e. observable properties of the surface, is considered an integral part of virtual 3D city and landscape models. Appearance relates to any surface-based theme such as infrared radiation or noise pollution, not just visual properties like RGB texture images. Consequently, data provided by appearances can be used as input for both, presentation of and analysis in virtual 3D city models.

The CityGML Conceptual Model supports feature appearances for an arbitrary number of themes per city model. Each LOD of a feature can have an individual appearance. Appearances can represent – among others – textures and georeferenced textures. CityGML’s appearance model is packaged within the Appearance module (cf. <<rc_appearance_section>>).
