[[ug_tunnel_discussion_section]]
==== Discussion

The tunnel model is closely related to the building model. It supports the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of tunnels and tunnel parts in four levels of detail, LOD0 to LOD3. The tunnel model of CityGML is defined by the thematic extension module Tunnel. <<figure-37>> provides examples of tunnel models for each LOD.

NOTE: This figure is from CityGML 2.0. It needs to be updated for CityGML 3.0

[[ug_tunnel-class]]
===== Tunnel Class

The Tunnel class is one of the two subclasses of `AbstractTunnel`. If a tunnel only consists of one (homogeneous) part, this class shall be used. A tunnel composed of structural segments, for example tunnel entrance and subway, has to be separated into one tunnel having one or more additional `TunnelParts` (see <<figure-39>>). The geometry and non-spatial properties of the central part of the tunnel should be represented in the aggregating Tunnel feature.

[[ug_tunnel_part_class]]
===== Tunnel Part Class

If sections of a tunnel differ in geometry and / or attributes, the tunnel can be separated into parts (see <<figure-39>>). Like `Tunnel`, the class TunnelPart is derived from `AbstractTunnel` and inherites all attributes of `AbstractTunnel`. A TunnelPart object should be uniquely related to exactly one tunnel or tunnel part object.

[[figure-39,Figure {counter:figure-num}]]

[[ug_abstract_tunnel_class]]
===== Abstract Tunnel Class

The abstract class `AbstractTunnel` contains properties for tunnel attributes, purely geometric representations, and geometric/semantic representations of the tunnel or tunnel part in different levels of detail. The attributes describe:

. The classification of the tunnel or tunnel part (class), 
. the different functions (function), and 
. the usage (usage). 

Spanning the different levels of detail, the tunnel model differs in the complexity and granularity of the geometric representation and the thematic structuring of the model into components with a special semantic meaning. This is illustrated in <<figure-40>>, showing the same tunnel in four different LODs. Some properties of the class `AbstractTunnel` are also associated with certain LODs.

NOTE: This figure is from CityGML 2.0 and needs to be updated to the CityGML 3.0 LODs.

.Tunnel model in LOD1 – LOD4 (source: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)).
image::figures/null.png[]

<<abstracttunnel_semantics>> shows the correspondence of the different geometric and semantic themes of the tunnel model to LODs. In each LOD, the volume of a tunnel can be expressed by a <<GM_Solid-section,GM_Solid>> geometry and/or a <<GM_MultiSurface,MultiSurface>> geometry. The definition of a 3D <<terrain-intersection-curve-section,Terrain Intersection Curve (TIC)>>, used to integrate tunnels from different sources with the Digital Terrain Model, is also possible in all LODs. The TIC can – but does not have to – build closed rings around the tunnel or tunnel parts.

NOTE: Update the LOD to CityGML 3.0 approach.

[[ug_hollow_space_class]]
===== Hollow Space Class

A HollowSpace is a semantic object for modelling the free space inside a tunnel and should be uniquely related to exactly one tunnel or tunnel part object. It should be closed (if necessary by using <<closure-surfaces-section,ClosureSurface>>) and the geometry normally will be described by a <<GM_Solid-section,GM_Solid>> (lod3Solid property). However, if the topological correctness of the boundary cannot be guaranteed, the geometry can alternatively be given as a <<GM_MultiSurface-section,GM_MultiSurface>> (lod3MultiSurface property). The surface normals of the outer shell of <<GM_Solid-section,GM_Solid>> must point outwards. This is important if appearences should be assigned to HollowSpace surfaces. In this case, textures and colors must be placed on the backside of the corresponding surfaces in order to be visible from the inside of the hollow space.

In addition to the geometrical representation, different parts of the visible surface of a hollow space can be modelled by specialised boundary surfaces (FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSur-face, cf. <<ug_model_construction_section>>).

[[ug_tunnel_installation_class]]
===== Tunnel Installation Class

A TunnelInstallation is permanent part of a Tunnel (inside or outside) which does not have the significance of a TunnelPart. In contrast to TunnelConstrucitveElement, a TunnelInstallation is not aessential from a structural point of view. Examples are stairs, antennas or railings. A TunnelInstallation optionally has attributes `class`, `function` and `usage`. The attribute `class` - which can only occur once - represents a general classification of the installation. With the attributes `function` and `usage`, nominal and real functions of a tunnel installation can be described. For all three attributes the list of feasible values can specified in a code list. 

For the geometrical representation of a TunnelInstallation, an arbitrary geometry object from the subset of ISO classes shown in <<iso-class-table>> can be used. Alternatively, the geometry may be given as ImplicitGeometry object (see <<prototypic-objects-section>>. Following the concept of <<implicit-geometry-concept,ImplicitGeometry>> the geometry of a prototype tunnel installation is stored only once in a local coordinate system and referenced by other tunnel installation features. The visible surfaces of a tunnel installation can be semantically classified using the concept of boundary surfaces. A TunnelInstallation object should be uniquely related to exactly one tunnel or tunnel part object.

[[ug_tunnel_furniture_class]]
===== Tunnel Furniture Class

Hollow spaces may have TunnelFurniture. A TunnelFurniture is a movable part of a hollow space. A TunnelFurniture object should be uniquely related to exactly one hollow space. Its geometry may be represented by an explicit geometry or an <<implicit-geometry-concept,ImplicitGeometry>> object. Following the concept of <<implicit-geometry-concept,ImplicitGeometry>>, the geometry of a prototype tunnel furniture is stored only once in a local coordinate system and referenced by other tunnel furniture features.

[[ug_tunnel_constructive_element_class]]
===== Tunnel Constructive Element Class

A TunnelConstructiveElement is an element of a Tunnel which is essential from a structural point of view. Examples are walls, slabs, and beams. A TunnelConstructiveElement optionally has attributes `class`, `function` and `usage`. The attribute `class` - which can only occur once - represents a general classification of the element. With the attributes `function` and `usage`, nominal and real functions of a tunnel constructuve element can be described. For all three attributes the list of feasible values can specified in a code list. 

[[ug_tunnel_lod_section]]
==== Level of Detail

NOTE: The term Boundary Surface is never defined.

The geometric representation and semantic structure of an <<abstract-tunnel-concept,AbstractTunnel>> is shown in <<tunnel-uml>>. The model is successively refined from LOD0 to LOD3. Therefore, not all components of a tunnel model are represented equally in each LOD and not all aggregation levels are allowed in each LOD. In CityGML, all object classes are associated to the LODs with respect to the proposed minimum acquisition criteria for each LOD. An object can be represented simultaneously in different LODs by providing distinct geometries for the corresponding LODs.

In LOD1, a tunnel model consists of a geometric representation of the tunnel volume. Optionally, a <<GM_MultiCurve-section,GM_MultiCurve>> representing the <<terrain-intersection-curves-section,TerrainIntersectionCurve>> can be specified. The geometric representation is refined in LOD2 by additional <<GM_MultiSurface-section,GM_MultiSurface>> and <<GM_MultiCurve-section,GM_MultiCurve>> geometries.

In LOD2 and higher LODs the outer structure of a tunnel can also be differentiated semantically by the class <<tunnel-installation-concept,TunnelInstallation>>. The <<tunnel-installation-concept,TunnelInstallation>> class is used for non-structural tunnel elements, like outer stairs, which strongly affecting the outer appearance of a tunnel. A TunnelInstallation may have the attributes class, function and usage.

The visible surface of a hollow space is represented geometrically as a <<GM_MultiCurve-section,GM_MultiCurve>> or <<GM_MultiCurve-section,GM_MultiSurface>>. Semantically, the surface can be structured into specialised `BoundarySurfaces`, representing floor (FloorSurface), ceiling (Ceil-ingSurface), and interior walls (InteriorWallSurface). Hollow space furniture, like movable equipment in control areas, can be represented in the CityGML tunnel model with the class <<tunnel-furniture-concept,TunnelFurniture>>. A TunnelFurniture may have the attributes class, function and usage.

[[ug_tunnel_uml_section]]
==== UML Model

The UML diagram of the Tunnel module is depicted in <<tunnel-uml>>. The Tunnel module inherits concepts from the Construction module (cf. <<ug_model_construction_section>>). The Construction module defines objects that are common to all types of construction, such as the different surface types and the openings.

The UML diagram of the tunnel model is shown in <<tunnel-uml>>. The pivotal class of the model is `AbstractTunnel`, which is a subclass of the thematic class `AbstractConstruction` (and transitively of the root class `CityObject`). `AbstractTunnel` is specialized either to a `Tunnel` or to a `TunnelPart`. Since an `AbstractTunnel` consists of `TunnelParts`, which again are `AbstractTunnels`, an aggregation hierarchy of arbitrary depth may be realized. As subclass of the root class `CityObject`, an `AbstractTunnel` inherits all properties from `CityObject` such as the feature properties (`name` etc.) and the CityGML specific properties like ExternalReferences (cf. <<ug_model_core_section>>). Further properties not explicitly covered by `AbstractTunnel` may be modelled as generic attributes provided by the CityGML Generics module (cf. <<ug_model_generics_section>>) or using the CityGML Application Domain Extension mechanism (cf. <<ug_model_ade_section>>).

==== Examples

The example in <<figure-42>> shows a pedestrian underpass in the city centre of Karlsruhe, Germany. On the left side of <<figure-42>>, a photo illustrates the real world situation. Both entrances of the underpass are marked in the photo by dashed rectangles. On the right side of the figure, the CityGML tunnel model is shown. The terrain surrounding the tunnel has been virtually cut out of model in order to visualize the entire tunnel with its subsurface body. The same underpass is illustrated in <<figure-43>> from a different perspective. The camera is positioned in front of the left entrance (black dashed rectangle in <<figure-42>>) and pointing in the direction of the right entrance (white dashed rectangle in <<figure-42>>). On the right side of <<figure-43>>, the tunnel model is shown from the same perspective. Again holes are cut in the terrain surface in order to make the subsurface part of the tunnel visible. An LOD1 representation of the nearby buildings is shown in the background of the model.

The model on the right also includes an LOD1 representation of the nearby buildings in the background (painted in light brown) (source: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), courtesy of City of Karlsruhe).
image::figures/inwork/Figure_43_b.png[]

The model is subdivided into one Tunnel (the actual underpass) and two TunnelParts (both entrances). The tunnel and tunnel parts are bounded by GroundSurface, WallSurface, RoofSurface. ClosureSurface objects are used to virtually seal the tunnel entrances. For safety reasons each of the two entrances has railings which are modeled as TunnelInstallation. Due to the high geometrical accuracy and the semantic richness, the model is classified as LOD3.
