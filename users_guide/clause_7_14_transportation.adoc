==== Synopsis

The Transportation module defines central elements of the traffic infrastructure. This includes the transportation classes `road`, `square`, and `track` for the movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, the transportation class `railway` for the movement of wheeled vehicles on rails, as well as the transportation class `waterway` for the movement of vessels upon or within water bodies.

==== Discussion

The transportation model of CityGML is a multi-functional, multi-scale model focusing on thematic and functional as well as on geometrical/topological aspects. Transportation features are represented as a linear network in LOD0. Starting from LOD1, all transportation features are geometrically described by 3D surfaces. The areal modelling of transportation features allows for the application of geometric route planning algorithms. This can be useful to determine restrictions and manoeuvres required along a transportation route. This information can also be employed for trajectory planning of mobile robots in the real world or the automatic placement of avatars (virtual people) or vehicle models in 3D visualisations and training simulators. 

The main class is <<abstract-transporation-space-concept,AbstractTransportationSpace>>, which represents, for example, a road, a track, a railway, a waterway, or a square. <<figure-57>> illustrates the different transportation classes.

NOTE: Need to add a waterway to figure 57.

Two major concepts associated with all transportation classes are Traffic Space and Auxillary Traffic Space. Traffic Space describes the space that traffic can traverse. Auxillary Traffic Spaces are associated spaces where traffic does not traverse. 

<<figure-58>> depicts an example for a LOD2 Transportation Space configuration within a virtual 3D city model. The Road consists of several Traffic Spaces for the sidewalks, road lanes, parking lots, and of Auxiliary Traffic Spaces below the raised flower beds.

The road itself is represented as a Road object with associated TrafficSpaces and AuxiliaryTrafficSpaces. The TrafficSpaces are those elements which are important in terms of traffic usage such as car driving lanes, pedestrian zones, and cycle lanes. The AuxiliaryTrafficSpaces describe further elements of the road like kerbstones, middle lanes, and green areas.

==== Level of Detail

The geometrical representation of the Transportation objects varies through the different levels of detail. 

In the coarsest LOD0 the transportation objects are modelled by line objects establishing a linear network. On this abstract level, path finding algorithms or similar analyses can be executed. It also can be used to generate schematic drawings and visualisations of the transport network. Since this abstract definition of transportation network does not contain explicit descriptions of the transportation objects, it may be task of the viewer application to generate the graphical visualisation, for example by using a library with style-definitions (width, color resp. texture) for each transportation object.

Starting from LOD1 a Transportation object provides an explicit surface geometry. This geometry reflects the actual shape of the object, not just its centerline. In LOD2 to LOD3, the object is further subdivided thematically into Traffic Spaces, which are used by transportation, such as cars, trains, public transport, airplanes, bicycles or pedestrians and into Auxiliary Traffic Spaces, which are of minor importance for transportation purposes. The different representations of a Transportation objects for each LOD are illustrated in <<figure-60>>.

In LOD0 areal transportation objects, like squares, should be modeled in the same way as in GDF. GDF is the ISO standard for transportation networks and is used in most car navigation systems. In GDF a square is typically represented as a ring surrounding the place and to which the incident roads connect. CityGML does not cover further functional aspects of transportation network models (e.g. speed limits) as it is intended to complement and not replace existing standards like GDF. However, if specific functional aspects have to be associated with CityGML transportation objects, generic attributes provided by CityGML’s <<ug_model_generics_section,Generics>> module can be used.

Moreover, further objects of interest can be added from other information systems by the use of <<external-references-section,ExternalReferences>>. For example, GDF datasets, which provide additional information for car navigation, can be used for simulation and visualisation of traffic flows. The values of the object attributes can be augmented or replaced by the use of <<codelists-section,CodeLists>> or <<ade-section,ADEs>>. These extensions may be country or user-specific (especially for country-specific road signs and signals).

The following example shows a complex urban crossing. The picture on the left is a screenshot of an editor application for a training simulator, which allows the definition of road networks consisting of transportation objects, external references, buildings and vegetation objects. On the right, the 3D representation of the defined crossing is shown including all referenced static and dynamic models.
