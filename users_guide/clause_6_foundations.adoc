This standard defines an open CityGML Conceptual Model (CM) for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape models. These models include the most relevant entities of the urban space like buildings, roads, railways, tunnels, bridges, city furniture, water bodies, vegetation, and the terrain. The conceptual schema specifies how and into which parts and pieces physical objects of the real world should be decomposed and classified. All objects can be represented with respect to their semantics, 3D geometry, 3D topology, appearances, and their changes over time. Different spatial representations can be provided for each object (outdoor and indoor) in four predefined Levels of Detail (LOD 0-3). The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model (<<ug-citygml-model-section>>) is formally specified using UML class diagrams, complemented by a data dictionary (<<data-dictionary-section>>) providing the definitions and explanations of the object classes and attributes. This Conceptual Model is the basis for multiple encoding standards, which map the concepts (or subsets thereof) onto exchange formats or database structures for data exchange and storage.

While the CityGML Conceptual Model can be used for 3D visualization purposes, its special merits lie in applications that go beyond visualization such as decision support, urban and landscape planning, urban facility management, Smart Cities, navigation (both indoor and outdoor), Building Information Modelling (especially for as-built documentation), integration of city and BIM models, assisted and autonomous driving, and simulations in general (cf. <<Kolbe2009>>). A comprehensive overview on the many different applications of virtual 3D city models is given in [<<Biljecki2015>>]. Many of the applications already use and some even require using CityGML.

In the CityGML CM, all 3D city objects can easily be enriched with thematic data. For example, street objects can be enriched with information about traffic density, speed limit, number of lanes etc., or buildings can be enriched by information on the heating and electrical energy demand, numbers of households and inhabitants, the appraised building value etc. Even building parts such as individual roof or wall surfaces can be enriched with information e.g. about solar irradiation and thermal insulation parameters. For many application domains specific extensions of the CityGML CM have already been created (cf. <<Biljecki2018>>).
