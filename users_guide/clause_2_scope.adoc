This document provides Engineering Guidance on the use of the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard. 

The OGC Conceptual Model Standard specifies the representation of virtual 3D city and landscape models. The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model is expected to be the basis for a number of future Encoding Standards in which subsets of the Conceptual Model can be implemented. These Encoding Standards will enable both storage and exchange of data. 

The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard was designed to be concise and easy to use. As a result, most non-normative content has been removed. The purpose of this Users Guide is to capture that non-normative content and make it easy to access if and when needed.
