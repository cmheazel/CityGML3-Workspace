CityGML 3.0
===========

This is the public repository for the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) CityGML Standards Working Group (SWG) version 3.0 of the CityGML Conceptual Model standard.

In order to increase the usability of CityGML for more user groups and areas of application, the OGC CityGML SWG and the Special Interest Group 3D (SIG 3D) of the initiative Geodata Infrastructure Germany (GDI-DE) have worked since 2014 on the further development of CityGML. This work will result in the next major version CityGML 3.0. The CityGML 3.0 standard will consist of at least two parts: 
1. the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model specification, and 
2. the CityGML 3.0 GML Encoding specifications

Further encoding specifications (e.g. relational database schema, JSON-based representation) will follow in the future.

The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard is also available in [PDF](http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-010.pdf) and [HTML](http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-010.html)

A CityGML 3.0 Users Guide is provided in addition to the CityGML 3.0 standard. The Users Guide provides non-normative information which may be of value to users of the Standard. 

The CityGML 3.0 Users Guide is available in [PDF](http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-066.pdf) and [HTML](http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-066.html)
